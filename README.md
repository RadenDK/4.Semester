# Foosball Tracker – 4th Semester Project

This project was developed in collaboration with **WEXO A/S** during our 4th semester. The goal was to create a system that could track foosball matches in real time to help gamify the workplace and make it more fun for employees.

The final result includes a frontend that:

- Displays a live leaderboard
- Shows when a match is in progress
- Updates scores in real time as goals are scored

This is made possible through an **ESP32** device mounted on the foosball table, which detects goals and sends data to our API. From there, the data is broadcasted to connected clients via **WebSockets**, allowing for a smooth and responsive experience.

It was a fun and challenging project where we got to explore a wide range of technologies — including IoT, real-time APIs, and WebSocket communication.
